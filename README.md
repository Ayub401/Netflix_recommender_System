# Netflix_recommender_System
In this repository i have tried to build a movie recommender system. The recommender system has been build from scratch without the Sklearn library. I have used cosine similarity to identify the similar movies. The note book contains all preprocessing steps and has descriptive comment so that one can easily understand.
